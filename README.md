# SecureMessage

**SecureMessage** is an easy-to-use application for encrypting and decrypting messages using the Fernet encryption method. With a simple interface, you can securely encrypt your messages and share them with others who have the same application to decrypt them.

## Features

- Encrypt any text-based message.
- Decrypt encrypted messages.
- Copy the results to the clipboard with a single click.
- Clear input and output fields.
- User-friendly and intuitive graphical interface (GUI).
## Requirements

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

### 1. Python 3.x
You can download the latest version of Python from the official website:  
[Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Make sure Python is correctly installed by running:

```bash
python --version
```

### 2. Required Libraries
This project relies on the following libraries, which can be installed via pip:

 - **cryptography** *(for message encryption and decryption)*
 - **tkinter** *(usually comes bundled with Python, used for the graphical interface)*
   
To install the required libraries, simply run the following command:

```bash
pip install cryptography
```
```bash
pip install tkinter
```

## 3. Firebase Realtime Database Configuration

In order for the application to work properly, you need to set up a Firebase Realtime Database and ensure that the Firebase configuration file **`(FireBaseConection.json)`** is located in the same directory as the executable **`(.exe)`**.

### Steps to Configure Firebase Realtime Database:

#### 1. Create a Firebase Project:
- Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
- Click **"Add Project"** and follow the steps to create a new project.

#### 2. Enable Firebase Realtime Database:
- Once your project is created, navigate to **"Realtime Database"** in the left sidebar.
- Click **"Create Database"** and choose a location for your database.
- Select **"Start in test mode"** if you're still testing the app (you can change the security rules later for production).

#### 3. Generate Service Account Credentials:
- Navigate to **"Project Settings"** by clicking the gear icon in the top left of the Firebase Console.
- Go to the **"Service Accounts"** tab.
- Click **"Generate new private key"**. This will download a JSON file containing your Firebase credentials.
- Rename this file to **`FireBaseConection.json`**.

#### 4. Ensure the Configuration File is in the Same Directory as the Executable:
- Place the **`FireBaseConection.json`** file in the same folder as the `.exe` file generated by PyInstaller.
- The application will look for the **`FireBaseConection.json`** file in its current working directory. If this file is missing or located elsewhere, the application will not be able to connect to Firebase.

  ### Database URL:

When initializing Firebase in the code, ensure the **`databaseURL`** is correctly set to match your Firebase project:

```python
firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred, {
    'databaseURL': 'https://<your-project-id>.firebaseio.com/'
})
```
#### Important Note:
The **`FireBaseConection.json`** file must be in the same folder as the `.exe` for the app to function correctly. If you distribute the app, make sure to include this file and inform users to keep it in the correct location.


## 4. Download the Executable

If you don't want to install Python or the required libraries, you can simply download the pre-compiled executable from the [Releases](https://github.com/YourUsername/SecureMessage/releases) section. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/YourUsername/SecureMessage/releases) page.
2. Download the latest version of the executable (e.g., `SecureMessage.exe` for Windows users).
3. Run the executable file directly.

No need to install Python or additional librariesâ€”just download and start using it!

## Application Walkthrough

1. **Message Field**: Enter any plain text message that you want to encrypt or decrypt.
   
2. **Encrypt Button**: Press this button to encrypt the message. The encrypted result will appear in the result field.
   
3. **Decrypt Button**: Press this button to decrypt an encrypted message. The decrypted result will appear in the result field.

4. **Copy Button**: Easily copy the result (whether encrypted or decrypted) to the clipboard for sharing or saving elsewhere.

5. **Clear Button**: Use this to clear both the input and result fields.
