# SecureMessage

**SecureMessage** is an easy-to-use application for encrypting and decrypting messages using the Fernet encryption method. With a simple interface, you can securely encrypt your messages and share them with others who have the same application to decrypt them.

## Features

- Encrypt any text-based message.
- Decrypt encrypted messages.
- Copy the results to the clipboard with a single click.
- Clear input and output fields.
- User-friendly and intuitive graphical interface (GUI).
## Requirements

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

### 1. Python 3.x
You can download the latest version of Python from the official website:  
[Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Make sure Python is correctly installed by running:

```bash
python --version
```

### 2. Required Libraries
This project relies on the following libraries, which can be installed via pip:

 - **cryptography** *(for message encryption and decryption)*
 - **tkinter** *(usually comes bundled with Python, used for the graphical interface)*
   
To install the required libraries, simply run the following command:

```bash
pip install cryptography
```
```bash
pip install tkinter
```
